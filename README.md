# Langton's Ant

Langton's Ant is a two-dimensional Turing machine with a very simple set of rules but complex emergent behavior. It was invented by Chris Langton in 1986 and runs on a square lattice of black and white cells. The concept has been generalized in several ways, such as turmites, which incorporate more colors and additional states ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant)).

## langtons_ant.py

- At a white square, turn 90째 clockwise, flip the color of the square, and move forward one unit.
- At a black square, turn 90째 counterclockwise, flip the color of the square, and move forward one unit.

### Requirements

- Python3
- numpy
- matplotlib

## langtons_ant.cpp, langtons_ant_kernel.cl, Makefile

Langton's Ant on OpenCL.

```
Usage: langtons_ant [-w width] [-h height] [-i interval_millis] [-P]
 -w : Field width.
 -h : Field height.
 -n : Number of ants.
 -i : Step interval in milli seconds.
 -P : Pause at start. Will be released by 'p' key.
```

### Requirements

- OpenCL
- OpenGL
- FreeGLUT

## langtons_ant2.py

This version is almost the same as Langton's Ant, but each ant has its own individual `color1` (representing white) and `color2` (representing black).

- At an initial square or a `color1` square, turn 90째 clockwise, change the color of the square to `color2`, and move forward one unit.
- At a `color2` square, turn 90째 counterclockwise, change the color of the square to `color1`, and move forward one unit.
- At a square with any other color, move forward one unit (without changing the color of the square).

### Requirements

- Python3
- numpy
- matplotlib
